# Hello, I'm Penda! 👋

Welcome to my digital space! I'm a full-stack web developer and artist currently based in Aarhus, Denmark 🇩🇰, originally from Windhoek, Namibia 🇳🇦.

As a resident of Earth 🌍, a mostly harmless planet in the unfashionable western spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy, I consider myself a global (and galactic) citizen. 

Remember: Don't Panic, and always know where your towel is!
